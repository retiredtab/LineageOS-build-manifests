Subject: [PATCH] vendorsetup: Disable ABI checks

ABI compatibility checks fail for several reasons:
  - The update to Clang 12 causes some changes, but no breakage has been
    observed in practice.
  - Switching to zlib-ng changes some internal structs, but not the public
    API.

We may fix these eventually by updating the ABI specifications, but it's
likely not worth the effort for us because of how many repos are affected.
We would need to fork a lot of extra repos (thus increasing maintenance
overhead) just to update the ABI specs.

For now, just skip the ABI checks to fix build errors.
